# bash_quiz

## Introduction

The code is really sloppy at the moment, but I just wanted to create a quick
bash tool to help me better understand bash.

Nothing serious here. Just playing around for the moment.

I may try to move the questions over to a sqlite DB and then read them in from there.

I mainly added it to git because it is currently stored on an SD card in an old Raspberry pi ;).

## To Run

Download the quiz_app.sh file and run from a bash cli:

`bash quiz_app.sh`
